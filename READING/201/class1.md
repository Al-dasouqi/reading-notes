**HTML**
# Introduction

* How to build and design websie from scratch*
* We can structure the page using HTML and style it using CSS.
* We can access the website from the browsers like : FireFox, Chrome, etc...

# Structure
To structe a page we uses HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language).
* This language uses tags, each one of these tags gives a meaning.
* There is an opening and closing for the tag.
* The opening tag contains attributes.
* Attributes tell us more about the content of that element.

# Extra Markup
* We used DOCTYPE to determine the version of HTML.
* For comment something or give an information we used <!-- -->
* Class and ID identify the elements.
* To gathering the block-level and inline elements together we use <div> & <span> elements.
* To give information about our web site we use <meta> tag.
* To display another page in our we site we can use <IFrame>tag.
* Also we can use the escape characters like: < , >

# HTML5 Layout
This chapter explain the new elements using in HTML5.

* Instead of using <div> element we replace it to a meaningful elements like <header>, <nav> and <article>
* The old that don't understand HTML5 we need to make sure that these elements are block-level.

# Process & Design

* The most importnat thing we need to know our audience and the target users.
* Gathering information about the intended users that intersted in our site.
* we need to do a wireframe (a design) how should our website appear to the other .
* The design will get and attract more users.

**JAVA SCRIPT**
# JavaScript

We used JS to make the websites more interactive and user-friendly, by accessing, modifying the content on the webpage, program and react.

**Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful**

### What is the script ?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To acheive our goal, we should divide the task into smaller steps :
* Define the goal.
* Design the script (FlowChart).
* And code each step.

### jQuery
 It makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.
