# CSS 
It is used to style the webpages.

**CSS rules** contains selectors and decleration.
p{font-family:Arial};

*declaration* made up of property and value.

We can use CSS rules in a seperate page or within HTML page using <Style> element.

## Color
*It is really bring your pages to life*.

**Foreground color**
There are three ways to specify the color in CSS :
1. RGB values : rgb(100,100,50) how much do you want to use red,green and blue.

2. HEX code.
Six-digit used to represent the amount of red, green, and blue in the color : #ee3e80.

3. Color names

**Backgrond color**
Sets the color of the background.

Uses the same ways of the Foreground color(RGB values, HEX code and color name ).

### Color picker helps us to choose the color we want.

* Contrast : we need to set up the constrast between any text & background to ensure it is readable. 
* RGBA     : RGB with opacity.
* HSLA     : we can also use it with opacity. 
**HSL** it is a new way to specify colors using Hue, Saturation and Lightness.
