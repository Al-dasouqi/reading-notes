**GIT** 

+Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Saves the changes you have made to your project and it is called -Commit-

+The Distributed Version Control systems(DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS.

To get started :

+Download GIT then we need to do some initial customization like (configuration of variables and identity settings).

Setting up a GIT repository by the following :

+Importing (To import an existing project or directory into Git).

+Cloning (create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server)

WorkFlow (Local repo structure):

+There is three components :

Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
Index: The area used for staging
Head: Points to the most recent commit.
And there are two ways to save changes :

1.Tracked : They can be modified, unmodified, or staged.

2.Untracked : They are not reside in the staging area.
