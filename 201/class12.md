**Charts.js**

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

* To get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in our page along with a single <canvas> node to render the chart.

<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>

*  <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.

*  We can draw on the canvas. how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. 

* We can add different colors, line styles, gradients, patterns and shadows to your drawings.
