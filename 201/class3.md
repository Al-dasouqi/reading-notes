**HTML**

# HTMLS Lists
There is three types of lists in HTML as below:

* Unordered list it comes with bullets when we mentioned more than one step. 

* Ordered list uses number to order the contents.

* Definition lists are used to define terminology.

## And for sure lists can be nested inside each other.

**CSS**

# Boxes

* Each element in HTML trated as if it is has it is own Box from CSS.
* For each box we can do the following :
1. Controlling the dimensions of the box.
2. Controlling the borders, margin and padding for each box.
3. Controlling size of boxes
* We can display and hide the boxes.
* So we can style and control the boxes in different ways using CSS.

**JavaScript**

# Arrays
It is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

* We can create an array as below :
- var colors;
- colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];

*Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).*

# Desions and loops 

* Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
