**HTML**

# Text
* We structure our we page using HTML.
* HTML using tags or called Markup.
* For text there is a structural markup(describes both headings and paragraph) and semantic markup (adding more information).
* So, you can make the text bold, italic and you can use acronyms, etc... .

# Introducing CSS

* Styling the way how the element should appears.
* It uses rules and those rules made up of selectors and declaration.

**CSS rules** contains selectors and decleration.
p{font-family:Arial};

*declaration* made up of property and value.

* We can use CSS rules in a seperate page or within HTML page using <Style> element.

**JAVA SCRIPT**

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

We used JS to make the websites more interactive and user-friendly, by accessing, modifying the content on the webpage, program and react.

**Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful**

### What is the script ?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To acheive our goal, we should divide the task into smaller steps :
* Define the goal.
* Design the script (FlowChart).
* And code each step.

### jQuery
 It makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

 * Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script

 ## Expressions
 An expression results in a single value.

 Types of expressions :
 1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE (For example - var color = 'beige' -).
 2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE (For example - var area = 3*2; ).

 ## Operators 
 Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

 Types of operators :
 1. Assignment operators(Assign value to a variable).
 2. Arithmetic operators(Perform basic math).
 3. String operators(Combine two strings).

 # Decisions and loops

 * Conditional statements allow our code to make decisions about what to do next.

 * Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

 * Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

 * if ... else statements allow us to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

 * switch statements allow us to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
