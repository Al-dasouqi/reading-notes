**HTML**
# Tables 

* The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> .0-element.
* Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

**Javascript**
# Object constructor

* The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. Then we can add properties and methods to the object.
* To update the value of properties, we us dot notation or square brackets. They work on objects creatred using literal or constructor notation. To delete property, use the delete keyword.
* We can use functions as a templete for creating objects.
* The keyword *this* is commonly used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help us write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
