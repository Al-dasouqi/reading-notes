# CSS 
**Transforms**

* With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements.
* Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.
* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
* Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isnâ€™t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.

*Syntax*
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}

**Transitions & Animations**

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

*Transition*

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

* Syntax :

.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  transition-property: background;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
}


*Animation*

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

* To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

* Syntax :

@keyframes slide {
  0% {
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
  }
  50% {
    left: 244px;
    top: 100px;
  }
  100% {
    left: 488px;
    top: 0;
  }
}
