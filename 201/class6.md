**JavaScript**

# Objects

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around us.
* In an object, *variables* are known as properties of the object; *functions* are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

# Document object model(DOM)

* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
* DOM trees have four types of nodes:
1. Document nodes
2. Element nodes
3. Attribute nodes
4. And text nodes.
* We can select element nodes by :
1. ID or 
2. class attributes.
* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadelist.
* From an element node, we can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
