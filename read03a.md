# Duckett HTML 

**Chapter 1**
### Structure of the web page

To write a good web pages we need to fully understand the structure the documents.

To structure the web pages we used HTML(Hyper text markup language).

Tags act like containers. They tell us information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

We can imagine the structure like the human body, we have the head, body and the footer.

**Chapter 8**
### Extra Markup

There is a different versions of HTML, we used doctype to specifies the HTML version.

* To add a Comment we use : <!-- -->
* id attribute and class  : allow us to identify particular elements.
   - we use them to refer back to CSS and styling the page.
* Block elements          : Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. like (<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.)
* Inline elements         : Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.Like(<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>)
* <div> element           : allows us to group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
* <span> element          : acts like an inline equivalent of the <div>
element. 
* iframe                  : is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. 
* The <meta> tag          : allows us to supply all kinds of information about our web page.
* Escape characters       : are used to include special
characters in our pages such as <, >, and ©.

**Chapter 17**
### HTML5 Layout

This chapter explain the new elements using in HTML5.

* Instead of using <div> element we replace it to a meaningful elements like <header>, <nav> and <article>
* The old that don't understand HTML5 we need to make sure that these elements are block-level.

**Chapter 18**
### Process & Design

* The most importnat thing we need to know our audience and the target users.
* Gathering information about the intended users that intersted in our site.
* we need to do a wireframe (a design) how should our website appear to the other .
* The design will get and attract more users.
