# Comparison Operators 
 We can compare values in the scripts to one we excepted and the results will be *Boolean*

 ### Examples 
**Is equel to**
"==", compare two values to see if they are the same.

**Is not equel to**
"!=", compare two values to see if they are not the same.

**Strict equel to**
"===", to check of the both *data type* and *value* are the same.

**Strict not equel to**
"!==",To check betwwen two values for the *data type* and *value* if thwy are not the same.

**Greater than**
">", to check if the value on the left is greater than to the other one.

**Less than**
"<", to check if the number on the left is less than the other number.

**Grater than or equel to**
">=", check if the number equel to the other number or greater than it.

**Less than or equel to**
"<=", check if the number equel to the other number or less than it.

### Keep in your mind, we use them for testing or checking the condition.
### We use the comparison operators to comapre two values to retur one single value(true or false).

# Logical operators
Allow us to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

### Examples
**Logical AND**
"&&", test more than one condition.

**Logical OR**
"||", test at least one condition.

**Logical NOT**
"!", Invert the boolean value.

# Loops
Lopps check a conditions. if the condition return true, then the code will be executed until it gives us a false.

### Types
1. For
If we need to run the code for specific number of times, so we use For.

2. While
If we need to run a code without knowing how many times i need to run it.

3. Do while
It's similiar to while loop exept that it always runs the code inside the curly braces at least once.

### Loop counters.
We use them as a condtion and it is mad of three statements:
* Initialization(var i = 0).
* Condition(i < 10).
* and update(i++).
