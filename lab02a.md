**Mind-Set**

Mindset is your collection of thoughts and beliefs that shape your thought habits. And your thought habits affect how you think, what you feel, and what you do.

Growth Mindset | Fixed Mindset 
---------------| -------------
Embraces challenges | Avoids challenges
Persists if there is any obstecles |Loses focus when there is an obstacles

From the above we can see two simple examples for the difference between the Growth and Fixed mindset. as the **Growth Mindset** he beleives that he can develop his abilitis by 
doing more effort and exercise more to get what he want.

On the hand, the **Fixed Mindset** he sees that his success come from inherit qualities. So, he don't need to deveop himself or give any effort to growth.


For me, there are reminders to keep me in the Growth mindset :
* No pain, No gain.
* If you can dream it, you can acheive it.
* Surrond myself with positivity.
