# REST

Brother: Oh? What did he do? ME: He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

Brother: How does that work, anyway? ME: The web? Brother: Yeah.

Brother: What? ME: Let's say you're talking to our sister and she wants to borrow Great Grandma's silver water jug or something.

Brother: So how do the machines tell each other where things are? ME: Ah! With a URL. If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun.

Brother: Ha, what about verbs and pronouns and adjectives? ME: Funny you asked because that's another big aspect of REST. Well, verbs are anyway.

Brother: Why can't a machine understand a normal web page? ME: Because web pages are designed to be understood by people.

Brother: So people would have to make machine formats for all their pages? ME: If it were valuable.
