## Component-Based Architecture

The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability.

As the software architecture is formulated, components are selected from the library and used to populate the architecture.

A user interface component includes grids, buttons referred as controls, and utility components expose a specific subset of functions used in other components.

Extensible A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Each component has its own interface that specifies required ports and provided ports; each component hides its detailed implementation.

A component should be extended without the need to make internal code or design modifications to the existing parts of the component.

Modification of technical complexity A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
